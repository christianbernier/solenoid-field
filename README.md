# Solenoid Field
Graphs the magnetic field produced by a current running through a solenoid in 3D. This is a project for my Electricity and Magnetism 1 (PHYS 3602) class.

## Running the script
To calculate the field and graph it, run the following command in the root of this project:

```
python3 solenoid-field.py
```
